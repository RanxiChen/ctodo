A set of case clauses enclosed in braces is a partial functionâ€”a function which may not be defined
for all inputs. It is an instance of a class PartialFunction[A, B]. (A is the parameter type, B
the return type.) That class has two methods: apply, which computes the function value from the
matching pattern, and isDefinedAt, which returns true if the input matches at least one of the
patterns.
